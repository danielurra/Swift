Xcode is Apple’s IDE, their main development tool, that will allows you to discover the Cocoa framework.</br>
Cocoa’s event-driven design Communicate with C and Objective-C.</br>
Thanks to polymorphism, you can take advantage of subclasses to add power and customization to existing classes.</br>
This is important particularly in the world of iOS programming, where most of the classes are defined by Cocoa and don’t belong to you.</br>
